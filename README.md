# Introduction

Pose estimation refers to computer vision algorithms that detect humans in images and video, so that one could determine, for example, where someoneâ€™s elbow shows up in an image. The algorithm is simply estimating where key body joints are.

PoseCamea is real time human pose estimation software which uses Pose estimation algorithm/techniques on webcam.
